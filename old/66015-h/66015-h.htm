<p>In preparing this history, I have been ably assisted
by Lieut.-Col. Eben P. Stanwood, Hon. E. J.
Sherman and the notes prepared by the late Wm. H.
Bartlett. To these surviving comrades, I extend my
warmest thanks.</p>

</div>


<p>I have undertaken to write a history of the Forty-eighth
Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteers, in the Civil
War in diary form from the commencement to the
close of the service. Undoubtedly much more might
have been written giving many interesting particulars
concerning the different companies and incidents relating
to individual members of those companies, but
I have thought best to write a modest, true and valuable
presentation of the main features of the services
rendered by the regiment to the Government. It is not
an easy task to write such a history as will please
everybody. I hope my efforts will be reasonably and
charitably considered by my comrades.</p>

</div>


<p>Few men in the North previous to April 12, 1861,
thought that the men of the South would be so rash as
to precipitate a war between the two sections, and when
on that day the news flashed over the wires that the
Southern fire-eaters had fired upon Fort Sumter, and
that the national ensign had been pulled down, a great
wave of horror and indignation swept over the land. A
call for 75,000 men for three months’ service was issued
by President Lincoln on the fifteenth day of April,
1861.</p>

<p>Many persons who considered themselves wise, pronounced
the number too great, and to most people it did
seem to be a vast army&mdash;three times greater than the
whole regular army previous to that time. But little
actual fighting was done by the regiments furnished
under this call, but subsequently other calls were made
for volunteers to serve for three years or during the
war.</p>

<p>On August 4, 1862, President Lincoln issued orders
for a draft of 300,000 men for nine months’ service, but
leave was granted to Governor Andrew to fill the quota
of Massachusetts by volunteers, and it was in answer to
this call that the men who later became the 48th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Massachusetts Infantry were recruited. It was the
intention (and great efforts were made by the gentlemen
interested in its formation) to make this an exclusively
Essex County regiment, but the exigencies of
the war made it imperative that all regiments in process
of formation should be immediately sent to the front,
and for this reason several partially formed regiments
were consolidated, and sent forward.</p>

<p>The regiments sent from Massachusetts under this
call were designated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>3d, Col. Silas Richmond; 4th, Col. Henry Walker;
5th, Col. George H. Pierson; 6th, Col. Albert Follansbee;
8th, Col. Frederick J. Coffin; 42d, Col. Isaac
S. Burrill; 43d, Col. Charles S. Holbrook; 44th, Col.
Francis L. Lee; 45th, Col. Charles R. Codman; 46th,
Col. George Bowler; 47th, Col. Lucius B. Marsh; 48th,
Col. Eben F. Stone; 49th, Col. William F. Bartlett;
50th, Col. Carlos P. Messer; 51st, Col. Augustus B. R.
Sprague; 52d, Col. Halbert S. Greenleaf; 53d, Col.
John W. Kimball, and the 11th Battery, Capt. Edward
J. Jones, which was the only battery of nine months’
men raised in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Of these regiments, the 3d, 5th, 6th, 8th, 43d, 44th,
45th, 46th, and 51st, served their time on the Eastern
coast; the 4th, 42d, 47th, 48th, 49th, 50th, 52d, and
53d served in the Army of the Gulf, on the Mississippi
River; the 11th Battery served in the Army of the
Potomac.</p>

<p>During the month of September, 1862, the men being
recruited for the Essex County regiment began to
rendezvous in “Camp Lander,” Wenham, Mass., and
the Hon. Eben F. Stone, a prominent lawyer of Newburyport,
was appointed “Commandant of Camp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Barracks had been provided for two or more regiments,
wells sunk, and every arrangement made for the
comfort of the men, several partially formed companies
of which came into camp during the month and were
mustered into the U. S. service as soon as they were
recruited to a minimum number.</p>

<p>Not much of special importance occurred to disturb
the regular routine of camp life while here, the days
being spent in actively drilling and becoming acquainted
with the duties of a soldier; but occasionally some
little break would be made in the monotony of camp
life; it seems that there had grown up a feeling
of jealousy among some of the officers of another regiment
in the camp, because Mr. Stone had been
appointed Commandant of Camp from civil life, and
without previous military training, when there were
other officers in camp who had had such training in the
Volunteer Militia, and on October 24 the dissatisfaction
culminated in an assault upon Capt. Stone’s headquarters
with bricks and other missiles, and for a time
matters assumed rather a warlike aspect, but finally
settled down with but very little bloodshed.</p>

<p>The quota of Massachusetts under this call was
19,090 men. The great numbers already in the field
and the fact that the last previous call of July 2, for
300,000 men for three years’ service had not been
entirely filled, made it more difficult to secure these
additional men but the officers worked with a will, and
soon no doubt was felt that the object would be attained,
and the call promptly answered. The first company to
secure the requisite number of recruits was the company
from Newburyport under command of Capt. Stone,
which was mustered September 16, and from that time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
forward companies were mustered as they obtained the
requisite number of men, until about November 1, when
there were about 750 men in camp, distributed in eight
different companies.</p>

<p>On the day previous to Thanksgiving Day the several
companies were furloughed to go home to spend
Thanksgiving, to report again in camp Saturday morning;
only one company reported in accordance with
orders, and as no other company put in an appearance,
the Captain gave his men leave to return home, but to
report again Monday morning, which they did, as did
the other companies, only to feel a little chagrined to
find that Adjt. Gen. Schouler, with a part of his staff,
had visited the camp on Sunday, and was very angry to
find the camp deserted by all but one Lieutenant and
just enough men for camp guard. His remarks were
reported to have been very forcible, succinct and pithy,
the air was said to have been lurid.</p>

<p>He said, “By God! I’ll send this regiment South or
to Hell!” and the men concluded that they hadn’t much
preference as to the two locations. As a compromise
between, the regiment was ordered to move to Camp
Meigs, at Readville, Mass., forthwith; but expecting to
be sent to one of the aforementioned places later on.</p>

<p>December 4, the regiment broke camp at Wenham
and left for Camp Meigs. While marching through
Boston at the intersection of Washington and Boylston
Streets, the two companies from Lawrence, commanded
respectively by Capts. Colby and Rollins left, being
transferred to the 4th Regiment which had been
recruiting at Lakeville, Mass., thus filling up that regiment,
and the unorganized 55th Irish Regiment, which
had been also recruiting at Lakeville was brought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Readville, and merged with the remaining six companies
from Wenham, which completed the organization
of this regiment, thus disposing of all expectation of an
Essex County regiment.</p>

<p>All the officers of the Wenham companies petitioned
the Governor to allow the Lawrence companies to remain
as formerly connected. They were a fine body of
men and officers, and, being in the same camp together
so long, a strong attachment had sprung up between the
different companies; but the request was denied. The
men and officers in the Irish regiment were also much
dissatisfied, and there were a great many desertions,
which (it was said) were encouraged by their officers;
a large number of the latter resigned and others were
summarily discharged. They had volunteered with the
understanding that they were to form an Irish regiment,
and they were very indignant that that arrangement
was not carried out.</p>

<p>The accession of these new men having given the
regiment the necessary number of men, on December
6 an election for field officers was held, and the regiment
became the 48th Regiment of Massachusetts Infantry.</p>

<p>Capt. Eben F. Stone of Newburyport was elected
Colonel, Mr. James O’Brien of Charlestown was elected
Lieutenant-Colonel, and Capt. George Wheatland of
Salem was elected Major.</p>

<p>The companies were designated as follows:&mdash;Co. A,
from Newburyport and vicinity; Co. B, from West
Newbury and vicinity; Co. C, from Salisbury and
vicinity; Co. D, from Newbury and vicinity; Co. E,
from Salem and vicinity; Co. F, at large; Co. G, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
large; Co. H, from Lowell; Co. I, at large; Co. K, at
large.</p>

<p>The line officers were as follows:&mdash;Co. A, Capt.
Woodward, Lieuts. Lawrie and Morrison; Co. B, Capt.
Stanwood, Lieuts. Rollins and Merrill; Co. C, Capt.
Pettengill, Lieuts. Currier and Schoff; Co. D, Capt.
Noyes, Lieuts. Lord and Wilson; Co. E, Capt. Howes,
Lieuts. Sanders and Lee; Co. F, Capt. Sherman,
Lieuts. Noyes and Burnett; Co. G, Captain (vacant),
Lieuts. Rudderham and O’Brien; Co. H, Capt. Rogers,
Lieuts. Frawley and Maginness; Co. I, Capt. McGuire,
Lieuts. Smith and Reade; Co. K, Capt. Todd, Lieuts.
Clark and Bellen.</p>

<p>December 22. Capt. McGuire of Co. I was discharged
and on the 26th Lieut. Smith was promoted to fill the
vacancy. This evening Edward Galligher of Co. H was
shot dead by Lieut. Lord of Co. D, Provost Marshal,
while drunk and disorderly, resisting arrest and assaulting
the Marshal.</p>

<p>The regiment remained in Camp Meigs until December
27 actively drilling and the raw recruits getting
whipped into shape for active duty in the field, but this
morning orders were received to break camp and leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
for New York and the South (or the other place previously
alluded to) and the regiment left at an hour’s
notice, proceeding by rail to Groton, Conn., where they
went on board the Sound steamer for New York arriving
there at an early hour in the morning of the 28th
and going at once on board the “Constellation,” an old
sailing vessel, just arrived from Europe with a load of
immigrants. It had not been properly cleansed and
was very foul and dirty; but it is a soldier’s duty to
bear with all sorts of inconveniences, and we soon
learned to accept them without an undue amount of
grumbling. There was no chance for a fire on board
except in the first cabin, consequently the line officers,
who occupied the second cabin, and the enlisted men
who were quartered between decks, suffered considerably
with the cold, but we were consoled with the thought
that if we were destined for either of the places
threatened by Gen. Schouler we should not be likely to
grumble on account of cold weather.</p>

<p>Friday, January 2, got under way at 12.30 P. M.,
being towed out by tug “Rattler,” which cast off and
left us at 4.15, taking ashore a large mail for friends left
at home.</p>

<p>January 8 we arrived off the mouth of Chesapeake
Bay with little of special importance transpiring.
Pilot came on board at 9.30 A. M. and we passed up the
bay where we found many of the fleet composing the
“Banks Expedition” of which we now find the 48th
is a part, and came to anchor just below and near
Fortress Monroe where we remained till January 15,
when under sailing orders the tug hitched on again and
we sailed away South at 2.30 P. M. in a gale of wind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
The voyage South lasted until the 30th day of January
during which the deadly ship fever (the surgeons call
it “Purpura”) broke out on board and several of our
men died from its effects and received a soldier’s burial
at sea.</p>

<p>It is a sad sight to see the poor fellows launched into
the deep dark waves, while their comrades stand nigh
with anxious tearful faces. The fever increasing rapidly
the men all came upon deck, the hatches battened
down and the ship thoroughly fumigated.</p>

<p>The following letter is self-explanatory:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sig">
On board Ship “Constellation,”<br />
in Gulf of Mexico,<br />
January 24, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>My dear Madam:&mdash;I have sad news to communicate.
Your son is no more on this earth. He was taken ill
last Wednesday, and, in less than twenty-four hours,
he was a corpse. He died at four o’clock P. M., on
Thursday and was buried at sunset in the Gulf Stream
off coast of Florida, Latitude 25, Longitude 20 west.</p>

<p>Let me assure you that everything possible was done
for him, by his comrades and our good surgeon, Dr.
Hurd, to save him from ravages of ship fever, but all
our efforts were in vain. The light of his youthful
countenance has gone out forever.</p>

<p>What can I say to you, his good mother, who gave
her only son an offering upon the altar of our common
country?</p>

<p>A fond mother will desire the sad details, his last
acts and words. An hour before he died, I told him
the doctor feared he could not live. He seemed to be
fully aware of his condition, and, turning his head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
toward me he said, “Tell mother I should rather have
died fighting the battles of my country, but God’s will
be done.” Very soon he drew his blanket over him and
calmly sank into the arms of death, like one “who
wraps the drapery of his couch about him and lies
down to pleasant dreams.”</p>

<p>His last thoughts were of his mother and he died
lamenting only his inability to do more for his country.</p>

<p>He was a mere boy in age and looks but he had the
judgment of an older patriot.</p>

<p>There are many creeds which will tell you that your
son has not gone to happiness or Heaven. He lived
an honest life, but died according to those creeds “unconverted.”</p>

<p>He died full of faith and hope, with a belief
that he had done his whole duty to his country
and his God. And I believe, in the language
of the Mayor of our goodly city, “He was
a soldier in a good cause, and at the command of
the Supreme Governor, he has laid down his arms and
gone up higher. Watchworn and weary, he has laid
his armor off and rests in Heaven. The everlasting

<p>Think then of your darling boy, not as dead but as

affliction. May God bless and comfort you, I am,</p>

<p>Captain Sherman, after returning home, was met by
the clergyman who officiated at the funeral of the
young soldier, who said, “Captain, I read your
letter at the funeral, and I do not think there
was a dry eye in the audience.” “But,” said the
Captain, “did you not regard the poetry as heretical?”
“You were fully justified,” said the clergyman,
“in writing anything you could to comfort
that poor heart-broken mother. But who knows that
he died unconverted? Were not his last words, ‘God’s
will be done?’”</p>

<p>In passing Cape Hatteras we experienced a fierce
storm, but the old ship floundered safely along through
the boiling sea with but little serious damage. The violent
motion of the ship and the corresponding and
sympathetic motion of our stomachs reminded us forcibly
of the old bass aria in Haydn’s Oratorio of “The
Creation,” “Rolling in foaming billows uplifted roars
the boisterous sea.” Except these and a few minor
incidents the voyage was uneventful.</p>

<p>The vacancy in Captain’s office in Co. G was filled
on January 15 by appointment of Lieut. Schoff to that
company as Captain.</p>

<p>On looking at the map of the United States we observe
that the State of Louisiana lies on both sides of
the Mississippi River and that the States of Arkansas
and Mississippi lay on the right and left banks of that
great stream, 500 miles of whose lower course was thus
controlled during the first year of the Civil War by
those three States unitedly inhabited by hardly as
many white people as the city of New York.</p>

</div>

<p>If we observe then the course drained by that river
and its tributaries, commencing with Missouri on its
right bank and Kentucky on its left bank, we find it
to consist of eight or nine large States, large portions
of three or four others, and several large Territories,
in all a country as large as Europe, as fine as any under
the sun, holding at the commencement of the war
more people than all the revolted States and destined
to become one of the most populous and powerful regions
on the face of the globe.</p>

<p>If any at the opening of the war supposed that those
powerful States, comprising a great and energetic population,
would ever consent to a peace that would put
the lower course of that great national outlet to the sea
in the hands of a foreign power far weaker than themselves,
they were blind indeed to the lessons of history.</p>

<p>The people of Kentucky alone before they were constituted
a State gave formal notice to the Federal Government
that if the United States did not conquer
Louisiana they would conquer it themselves. In the
words of a distinguished citizen of that martial State:
“The mouths of the Mississippi belong by the gift of
God to the inhabitants of its great valley. Nothing
but irresistible force can disinherit them.”</p>

<p>Akin to this was the feeling of the men of the Northwest
at the outbreak of the Civil War. With them
the opening of the Mississippi was an absorbing passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and they entered on that enterprise with alacrity and
with a grim determination not to cease from their efforts
until that great river which forms a part of the
life and very existence of the West should be repossessed,
and the insulted ensign of the Republic planted
on the last battlements of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>By the Summer of 1863, after many a bloody fight
on the river and on the land, they had reached Vicksburg,
and Grant had drawn his lines of investment
around that stronghold. Meantime their brethren of
the East had ascended the river from its mouth and
had taken possession of all the rebel defences on the
lower Mississippi. Subsequently Farragut, being away
on the Gulf coast, the rebels seized the opportunity to
fortify and garrison Port Hudson, in Louisiana. There
remained then at the opening of the Summer of ’63
these two strongholds, Vicksburg and Port Hudson,
the retention of which was necessary to the Confederates
if they would maintain their hold on the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Both parties to the struggle realized the importance
of these positions. Jefferson Davis, while on a visit to
Mississippi to inspect the defences of Vicksburg, spoke
as follows in a speech at Jackson before the Mississippi
Legislature: “Vicksburg and Port Hudson are the
real points of attack. Every effort will be made to capture
these places with the object of forcing the navigation
of the Mississippi and severing the eastern from
the western portion of the Confederacy. Let all then
who have at heart the welfare and safety of the country
go without delay to Vicksburg and Port Hudson.
Let them go for thirty or sixty or ninety days. Let
them assist in preserving the Mississippi River, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
great artery of our country, and thus conduce more
than in any other way to the perpetuation of the Confederacy
and the success of our cause.”</p>

<p>Most people probably have a tolerably clear idea of
Grant’s campaign against Vicksburg. As the history
of the 48th Regiment is inseparably connected with
the siege and capture of Port Hudson, it is proper that
at this point some description of that place and its
defences should be given.</p>

<p>Port Hudson is situated on a bend on the eastern
side of the Mississippi about twenty-two miles north
of Baton Rouge, and 147 miles from New Orleans. It
is 300 miles below Vicksburg. The bluff rising abruptly
some forty feet above the surface of the river was covered
with fortifications for a space of nearly four
miles, constructed upon the most scientific principles
of military art and armed with the heaviest and most
approved guns which England could furnish the Confederates.</p>

<p>The river as it approaches the bend suddenly narrows
and the current striking the west bank is thrown
across with great velocity and carries the channel almost
directly under the precipitous cliffs. Any vessel
attempting the passage would be compelled to run the
gauntlet of a plunging fire from the batteries which
commanded the river for several miles above and below.
Thus it will be seen that on the river side the position
was so fortified by nature and art that it was practically
impregnable.</p>

<p>On the land side it was scarcely less so. There it
was protected by a high parapet extending some seven
or eight miles in a semi-circle from river to river, in
front of which was a ditch from ten to twelve feet wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
and six feet deep. Along nearly the whole line in
front of this ditch and extending from half a mile to
a mile from it was formerly a heavy growth of timber.
This had all been cut down; so that in every direction
the fallen tops of trees interlaced, trunks blocked up
every passage and brambles were growing over the
whole. Moreover, the space where this forest had
stood was cut up in every direction by gullies and
ravines, all containing more or less fallen timber.
Under favorable circumstances, that is with a good
supply of ammunition and provisions, and a garrison
of 20,000 men, Port Hudson could have resisted any
force that could have been brought against it.</p>

<p>The task of taking this stronghold fell to the lot of
the Army of the Gulf, consisting mainly of the 19th
Army Corps, to which the 48th M. V. M. was attached.</p>

<p>Two o’clock in the morning of Jan. 30, 1863. The
old ship Constellation, bearing the 48th Regiment, is
lying off the southwest pass of the Mississippi River
and is throwing up rockets as a signal for a pilot.
Presently a tug comes steaming out from the river and
as daylight is breaking we leave the muddy waters of
the gulf behind us, not, however, without the assistance
of a second powerful tug to take us over the bar, and
enter the still muddier waters of the Mississippi. For
some miles the river presents no objects of interest.
Low marshy shores covered with coarse sedges, fit
haunts for alligators and other venomous reptiles&mdash;in
all about as uninviting a place as can well be imagined.
Towards noon we reach the famous Forts Jackson and
St. Philip, one of which gives us a salute as we pass.</p>

<p>They were occupied at this time by the 26th Massachusetts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Regiment who cheered us lustily as we passed.
At 9 o’clock A. M., January 31, arrived at quarantine
where the ship was boarded by the health officer, who
discovered no reason to detain us, although so very
recently having been scourged by the ship fever, and he
declared us “all right” and gave us a clean bill.</p>

<p>The only evidence of the desperate fight of the year
before when Farragut ran the gauntlet of these forts
are the remnants of several rebel gunboats which were
destroyed during the fight and driven as high as possible
on the banks of the river, and the Union sloop-of-war
Varuna, which lay on the bottom of this river with
only the tops of her masts out of water. After passing
the forts, as we approach New Orleans the country becomes
somewhat more interesting. We pass some fine
plantations with stately mansions, large sugar houses
and long rows of cabins, the habitations of the blacks.
Much of the way we run close to the bank and as we
turn bend after bend in the river we are tantalized by
the sight of orange groves laden with the luscious fruit&mdash;so
near and yet so far. We see very few white men.
Most of them have doubtless gone into the rebel army.
Now and then a planter standing on the bank gazes at
us sullenly as we pass. It seemed evident that they
were not over-pleased to see us. Our only welcome was
from the negroes. Their shouts from the levee, accompanied
by laughter and frantic gesticulations, bespoke
their joy. One white man, bolder than his fellows,
shouted the inquiry: “What regiment is that?” and being
informed he imparted the cheerful information
that we had come all the way from Massachusetts to
find our graves&mdash;a prophecy which proved true of
many a boy on board that ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>February 1, Sunday, at 3 A. M., we reached New
Orleans and anchored opposite the central part of the
city, where we remained during the next day.
Looking at New Orleans at that time, it was hard
to realize that just previous to the opening of
the war it had the largest export trade of any city
in the world. Its stores closed, its fine business
blocks deserted, its levee which had once groaned
with the burden of a great commerce empty and desolate,
the great metropolis of the Southwest lying under
the guns of our ships of war was a mute but vivid witness
of the folly of rebellion.</p>

<p>Leaving New Orleans on the 3rd at 11.45 A. M. we
proceeded up the river. Above New Orleans the desolation
became more marked. War had written his
autograph over the whole face of the country. Crops
of sugar cane which should have yielded thousands of
pounds of sugar were still standing in February, when
they should have been gathered months before. No
hope of saving them, for the frost had been at work
upon them. Moreover, the planter’s negroes had left
him, his horses had been stolen, his mules and teams
confiscated by the Government. Defiant amid the general
wreck, the planters were said to be bitterly cursing
President Lincoln and praying for the destruction of
the Union armies.</p>

<p>The village of Donaldson, the first place of importance
above New Orleans, presented a sorry sight. Its
inhabitants had had the bad habit of firing on our
weaker steamers as they passed up and down the river.
Farragut bore the outrage until forbearance ceased to
be a virtue, and then assured the people that if the outrage
were again repeated he would shell the town. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
was again committed and Farragut, true to his word,
bombarded the place until only about half of the original
town was left.</p>

<p>Approaching Baton Rouge, 125 miles above New
Orleans, on the morning of the 4th, the first thing that
attracted our attention was the ruined Capitol of the
State, grim and ghastly in the morning light. This
fine building was fired when our forces took possession
of the town, by whom will never be known. The rebels
charged the Unionists with doing the deed when they
entered the place, and the Unionists as stoutly asserted
that it was the last act of the rebels before leaving.
The magnificent library, fine furniture and works of
art were all destroyed. Only Powers’ statue of Washington,
the work of Northern genius, was rescued from
the flames.</p>

<p>Our steamer drew up to the levee at Baton Rouge
just as the sweet notes of the reveille were sounding
from camp to camp, bugles echoing bugles, fifes warbling,
drums beating, while here and there from a distant
camp came the rich swell of a full band.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest delight that we disembarked,
for we had already learned what it was to suffer. Confined
for six weeks on an old hulk for which the Government
was paying more every week than the ship
was worth, we had not escaped the ravages of disease.
The transport on which we had made the trip from
New York had formerly been an emigrant ship. The
seeds of disease were lurking in her timbers. While
we were on the Atlantic a fatal disease&mdash;a spotted
fever&mdash;broke out, and in a few days several of our boys
had fallen victims and were consigned to a watery
grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>And now once again on terra firma our spirits rose
accordingly, and there was a general feeling of hopefulness
and cheer in our ranks as we marched over the
bluff to a plain about two miles from the village, where
we pitched our tents on a spot which was to be our
home for several weeks. Our camping ground had once
been occupied by the rebels for the same purpose. It
was a part of the field on which the battle of the previous
year had been fought. The trees in the vicinity
still showed the effects of the shot and fragments of
shell, the bones of animals and soldiers’ graves showed
that our troops had gained no bloodless victory.</p>

<p>Picket duty, guard duty, and the routine of drill was
our life for several weeks. The battlefield with its
terrors had thus far kept aloof but we were brought
face to face with a chapter of army life hardly less sad.</p>

<p>Though Baton Rouge and the country northward is
much more healthful than the fever level below, still
there is no place in all that region where one can lead
the exposed life of a soldier with impunity. Many of
our most rugged men yielded to the fatal miasm with
which the night air is laden, and those who had never
known a day’s sickness in their lives went daily at the
surgeon’s call to get their dose of quinine. Death came
and mustered out many. Funerals were of daily occurrence
and sometimes it seemed of almost hourly occurrence.
The notes of the dead march, the sad, sad
wailing of the fife, the mournful throb of the muffled
drum, the march with downcast eyes and arms reversed,
the parting volley above the grave, and then the return
march, quick time, arms at the right shoulder, fifes
warbling like birds in springtime, and drums beating
merrily&mdash;these sights and sounds were far too common.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Our sojourn at Baton Rouge was a period of waiting
expectancy. We were learning that to wait is one of
the chief duties of a soldier as it is indeed one of the
most irksome.</p>

<p>On February 5 the regiment received a few old “Sibley”
tents, a lot which had been left behind by some
departing regiment. They were musty old things, but
some of the boys went into them until our new ones,
which we are entitled to, should arrive. Today the
48th was brigaded with the 116th New York, the 21st
Maine and the 49th Massachusetts, constituting the
1st Brigade, 1st Division, 19th Army Corps, with
Maj.-Gen. C. C. Augur&mdash;a regular army officer&mdash;in
command of the Division; Col. E. P. Chapin of the
116th New York (Senior Colonel) in command of the
Brigade, and Maj.-Gen. N. P. Banks in command of
the Department, which was designated as the “Department
of the Gulf,” and on February 6 muskets and
ammunition were dealt out and we then for the first
time considered ourselves full-fledged soldiers of
“Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p>On March 11 there was a grand review of the troops
then at Baton Rouge. The sight of 20,000 well-drilled
troops, infantry, cavalry, and artillery is no ordinary
spectacle. Banks on his coal-black stallion with his
Division and Brigade Commanders made a distinguished
appearance, but the writer recalls that his interest centered
chiefly in Farragut who with the Captains of the
fleet had been invited to witness the parade.</p>

<p>At length on March 12 at 9 P. M. an order came to
have twenty-four hours cooked rations and forty
rounds of ammunition and be ready to march<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
at a moment’s notice. At daybreak the next morning
we marched to the levee at Baton Rouge where we
embarked on board a steamer and sailed slowly up the
river. Another regiment accompanied us and two companies
of cavalry. We had started on a reconnaissance.
We were convoyed by the famous gunboat Essex which
kept a half a mile ahead of us and occasionally threw a
shell into the woods along the shore. We disembarked
a few miles below Port Hudson under cover of the guns
of the Essex. The road leading to the bluff a distance
of a quarter of a mile from the river, swollen by the
spring freshets, was entirely under water, in some places
reaching nearly to the waists of the shorter men.
Wading through this the order of march was formed
upon the bluff. The cavalry went ahead, filling the
road and stretching out over the fields on either side.
We approached within a few miles of the Confederate
works and drove in their pickets who left their posts
so rapidly as to leave their cooking utensils lying near
the smouldering embers of the fire where they had
cooked their morning meal. Presently we came upon a
company of guerillas who fled to the woods, all but one
young fellow who was captured. At about noon, hot,
tired and thirsty, we halted for a brief rest at a plantation
some sixteen miles from Baton Rouge and I doubt
if at any time or place during the great conflict the
confiscation law was more vigorously and thoroughly
enforced. Within a few minutes after our arrival the
feathered inhabitants of the plantation had nothing
further to say. Our march from this place to Baton
Rouge was a rapid one. We were within a short distance
of a comparatively large and powerful army of
the enemy and it was quite within the bounds of possibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
that a force might be sent out to fall upon us
before we could reach our camp. But the reconnaissance
on the whole was a success. The road was clear
of rebels and about five miles from Baton Rouge where
the Montecino Bayou crosses the road we met the
division of General Cuvier Grover fresh from their
camp at Baton Rouge. No one who witnessed those
regiments of infantry and cavalry and the fine batteries
accompanying them as they crossed the pontoon bridge
and came springing up the hillside, and with their gun-barrels
glistening in the rays of the setting sun disappeared
from view on the winding road ahead will ever
lose the impression there gained.</p>

<p>We reached our camp at Baton Rouge at about
9 o’clock. Most of us were footsore and all were
weary, and creeping into our tents we were just
settling down to a good night’s rest when down
from headquarters came an order to march at 3
the next morning. So in the early morning we fell
in each heavily laden with knapsack, a full supply of
cartridges and two days’ rations, and started on the road
over which we had come the previous day. The morning
was cool, the road in good order, trees just budding
out and festooned with vines and moss. On the whole
we enjoyed the scenery of the Southern forest road and
the fresh morning air. Neither the heavy burdens nor
the blistered feet caused by yesterday’s weary march
could wholly repress our enthusiasm, ignorant as we
were of campaign life and eager for a change. But as
we got out into the open country and old Sol rising
higher and higher got in his work upon us our burdens
seemed heavier and heavier every moment and every
step was an agony. With rout step and arms at will, on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
on we plodded through clouds of dust. No wonder that
some of the boys sank by the side of the road exhausted,
only to come up late in the evening after the regiment
had bivouacked. But the longest day and the weariest
march must have an end and as the shades of night
were falling we halted at a corn field where, after a
hasty meal, we bivouacked for the night. With knapsacks
for pillows and the starry heavens for canopy we
lay along the ridges of the corn field and tired Nature’s
sweet restorer, balmy sleep, soon came to our relief.</p>

<p>The writer remembers being hastily awakened after a
few hours sleep by the comrade by his side who said,
“Look up over the trees!” and there we could easily
trace the course of the shells from Farragut’s mortar
boats and could hear their dull, explosive thud as they
fell inside the works at Port Hudson. But even that
display of fireworks interested us but for a moment.
Soon we were again sleeping soundly unconscious of the
tumult on the river. Shortly after midnight the cry,
“fall in” passed along the lines and slinging knapsacks
and shouldering rifles we passed out of the field past
the long, long lines of sleeping men and were again
on the march, this time away from Port Hudson.
What this movement meant we could not comprehend.
Had disaster befallen the fleet or our troops at the
front? Were we beginning the retreat? All was doubt
and uncertainty. We stumbled along in the thick darkness
through the dense woods, the silence of which was
broken only by an occasional heavy booming sound from
the river. The black darkness of the night grew heavier
and heavier. It was at that darkest hour just before
the dawn when all at once the entire heavens were
aglow. An instant flash of lights as bright as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
brightest noonday penetrated the inmost recesses of the
forest and for a moment sharply outlined every soldier’s
form&mdash;then came a sound that shook the very earth,
that thundered and reverberated along the entire
horizon&mdash;then all was still and dark. “What is it?”
was the question on every lip. Not until morning had
fully dawned did we learn that it was the dying cry of
the old warship Mississippi as she sank to her rest
beneath the waters of the river whence she had received
her name.</p>

<p>The events of that memorable night form one
of the most stirring chapters of the history of the
war. Farragut having learned of our loss of the
steamer Queen of the West between Vicksburg and Port
Hudson determined to run past the batteries at the
latter place and recover command of the river above.
So in his stout flagship, the Hartford, lashed side by
side with the Albatross he led the perilous adventure
arriving abreast of the rebel works at about midnight.
The rebels were on the watch and immediately the flames
of a vast bonfire in front of the heaviest batteries
lighting up the entire breadth of the river shot up into
the sky and the next instant the earth trembled to the
roar of all the rebel batteries, whereupon our mortar
boats below began firing thirteen-inch shell, and four
frigates and five gunboats moved up into the fight. As
our ships came past within pistol shot of the batteries
grape and canister swept their decks with murderous
discharges, the crescent shape of the river enabling them
to rake each vessel as it approached and again as it
receded. By 1 o’clock the fight was virtually over,
the Hartford and the Albatross having passed while
most of their consorts had failed and dropped down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
to their anchorage below, when a fresh blaze told of a
heavy loss. The Mississippi had run aground directly
abreast of the heaviest and most central battery where
her helpless plight was soon discovered and she at once
became a target for them all. Here Capt. Melancthon
Smith fought her nearly half an hour until she was
completely riddled, when he ordered her set on fire and
abandoned, and she was burning ashore until she was so
lightened that she floated, when she drifted down the
river a blazing ruin, exploding several miles below
when the fire had reached her magazine.</p>

<p>The morning after this memorable night found the
48th guarding a bridge on a road parallel to the main
road from Baton Rouge to Port Hudson. We had
fuel prepared ready in an emergency to burn the bridge
as it was feared the enemy’s cavalry might attempt to
make a dash on the flank of our army. No cavalry
appeared, however, and we were soon withdrawn and
went into camp on the banks of the Montecino Bayou.
And now the troops came pouring back from Port
Hudson. They had advanced to the outer works, fired
a few shots and retired. Not realizing that the movement
was but a feint intended to deceive the enemy in
the hope that they might withdraw some of their heavy
guns from the bluff and thus make easier the passage of
the fleet, Bank’s soldiers showered curses on him and his
tactics. They grew calmer when he issued a proclamation
saying that the object of the expedition had been
successfully accomplished. A week later all the troops
were withdrawn to Baton Rouge. Banks with the larger
part of the army left for an expedition in Western
Louisiana and our Division was left to garrison Baton
Rouge. We took up again the daily routine of picket
duty, guard duty, and drill, varied occasionally by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
night alarm from the picket line when we would hastily
fall in in the darkness and prepare to meet an enemy
that did not come. Such was our life for two months.
Its monotony was broken on the 2d of May when Grierson
with his troopers dusty, haggard and wayworn,
rode into Baton Rouge. The story of their coming and
of their incredible adventures flew like wild fire through
the camps and the excitement was at a high pitch.
Nothing like it had been known before in the war.
Seventeen hundred men had ridden through the entire
length of the State of Mississippi from the northeast to
the southwest corner, encountering every conceivable
danger and hardship. Thousands of Confederates had
been trying to find and intercept them. But with
matchless skill Grierson had escaped them by circuits,
outwitted them by ruses, and attacked and routed them
with far inferior numbers. In this raid of 600 miles
through a country swarming with foes they had cut
two railroads, burned nine bridges, destroyed two locomotives
and nearly 200 cars, broken up three rebel
camps, destroyed more than $4,000,000 worth of
Confederate government property, captured and paroled
1,000 prisoners and brought in with them 1,200 captured
horses. Hundreds of dark-hued patriots accompanied
them into Baton Rouge mounted on mules and
horses they had borrowed from their late masters.
Some idea of the pluck and endurance of the
Westerners may be obtained from the fact that
during the twenty-eight hours preceding their arrival
at Baton Rouge they had marched more than sixty
miles, had four fights and crossed the Comite River
where it was necessary to swim their horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>As the month of May wore away boat load after boat
load of troops arrived at Baton Rouge and it soon
became evident that the long-looked for movement
against Port Hudson was at hand. The 48th received
marching orders on the 11th and on the 18th was
again on the familiar road to Port Hudson, starting on
an expedition from which many in that column were
never to return.</p>

<p>That night we camped sixteen miles from Baton
Rouge where we remained until the 21st, on which day
we received our baptism of fire. The regiment got into
line at an early hour and took up line of march for
Port Hudson. We had not moved a mile before the
booming of guns ahead announced that our advance had
found the enemy and in all probability we would soon
be engaged.</p>

<p>On arriving at the intersection of the Bayou Sara
and Port Hudson roads near the “Plains Store,” so
called, located at that point, the advance was checked
by shots from a rebel battery planted at the “store.”
Col. Dudley’s Brigade was in the advance and received
the first shock; some of his troops skirmished in front
while others made a flank movement, and the rebels
were routed after quite a sharp engagement.</p>

<p>Lieut. Tucker of the Massachusetts 49th, acting on
Col. Chapin’s staff, lost a leg by cannon shot. After the
battle was supposed to be over, and the rebels had precipitately
retired, the Division (excepting the 48th)
made preparations to bivouac in the field at the right
and left of the Bayou Sara road near the “Plains
Store.” A section of the 5th U. S. Regular Battery
was sent a short distance up the Port Hudson road and
the 48th Massachusetts was ordered to its support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>Col. Stone was informed that the Illinois cavalry were
picketing on his front and right, and the 174th New
York infantry on his left, and he was cautioned very
strictly to be careful and not shoot those pickets by
mistake.</p>

<p>The Staff Officer who conducted the 48th to its
position, led them (and also the battery), entirely outside
the pickets, so that unknown to Col. Stone the 48th
was in a very exposed position, with neither front nor
flanks protected. Cos. H and K were detached from the
right wing and sent to the rear to guard the baggage
train, leaving only three companies, B, E and D, in that
wing; these three companies of the right wing, under
Lieut.-Col. O’Brien, filed into the woods on the right
hand side of the road; and the left wing, Cos. F, G, I,
A and C, with Col. Stone, into the woods on the left-hand
side of the road, and the battery was placed in the
road between the two wings which were entirely separated
from each other. Scarcely had the regiment
taken its position when the rebels commenced shelling
us and our battery smartly returned their fire. While
this was transpiring a force of rebel infantry passed
around the left flank, and to the rear of the left wing,
and as soon as the artillery fire ceased, fell upon them
while totally unprepared. The suddenness of the attack
threw them into confusion and they gave way and
retreated to the rear. The advance of the rebels was
met by a countercharge of the 116th New York and
the rebels were routed.</p>

<p>A portion of the rebel forces crossed the road and
came upon the left flank and rear of the right wing.
Lieut.-Col. O’Brien attempted to change front by
throwing back his left, but a portion of the men became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
confused, and Col. O’Brien ordered a retreat. This
order was not heard by Capt. Stanwood. Seeing some
of his men about to fall back in disorder he ordered
them to stand fast, which they did, and with a portion
of Cos. E and D fell back about 100 yards and took a
new position, rallying on the colors.</p>

<p>General Augur was at the rear and near the Plains
Store and witnessed the occurrence: The battery guns
went to the rear before the right wing left its position.
Col. Stone lost both his horses, captured. At night Co.
B went on picket.</p>

<p>The 48th lost two killed, several wounded and prisoners
in the fight today.</p>

<p>May 22. Co. B was relieved from picket by Co. F.
Calvin A. Farrington of Co. B was missing at roll call,
having been taken prisoner. Lieut.-Col. O’Brien and
Captain Stanwood were requested to come to Maj.-Gen.
Augur’s headquarters, which they did, and were complimented
very highly for the part sustained by the right
wing in yesterday’s battle; and also some of the officers
and men of the left wing who rallied on the colors.
The numbers in the right wing were so few that the
General supposed at the time that there was but one
company. He said the regiment did as well as any but
veteran troops would do under the circumstances; that
they had by mistake been placed in the wrong position
and were very badly posted on either side of the road.
He kindly criticised Lieut.-Col. O’Brien and told him
that he made a great mistake by trying to make a wheel
to the rear in the face of an aggressive enemy, his
men being under fire for the first time; none but seasoned
troops could do that safely. He said the Lieutenant-Colonel
should have ordered the right of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
command forward and met the enemy, and taken the
aggressive, and he had confidence, from what he witnessed
of their steadiness, that the men would have supported
him. He then complimented the men for coolness
under fire and said no doubt the regiment would feel
chagrined at the outcome of their first battle, but no
doubt an early opportunity would be given them to
retrieve themselves. He also said that if the regiment
should be called upon for volunteers for an assaulting
party, in a future assault (which he thought would be
the case very soon) he directed Captain Stanwood of
Co. B and his company not to feel as if called upon, but
to remain with the main body of the regiment, that
he would not be expected to volunteer in any forlorn
hope or assaulting party. His 1st Lieut. (Rollins)
detailed to Col. Chapin’s staff. Lieut. Merrill was
acting Quartermaster of the regiment for some considerable
time.</p>

<p>May 23. Alarm in the night&mdash;long roll beaten&mdash;regiment
turned out under arms, but the alarm proved
to be false. 48th ordered far down to the rear of the
1st Battery fight on the Bayou Sara road.</p>

<p>Co. E’s men proved themselves good foragers, bringing
in quantities of poultry and pigs.</p>

<p>May 24. Regiment ordered to march to the front
with one day’s rations at 6 o’clock A. M. Co. B
was detached and sent forward skirmishing into a
narrow strip of woods; the mud and water were very
deep and almost impenetrable. They advanced, however,
with great difficulty through the woods to within
about 300 yards of the rebel works and there remained
through the day, lying in the edge of the woods, and
witnessed the artillery battle between the opposing batteries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
in our immediate front till nearly dark when
they were relieved by the Massachusetts 49th.</p>

<p>May 25. There was a smart fight near night upon
our right in Gen. Grover’s Division and some rebs
attempted to cut their way out but failed and were taken
prisoners. The regiment ordered to sleep on their
arms tonight.</p>

<p>May 26. One false alarm during the night. Regiment
got into line promptly, but as promptly dismissed.
Orders received from headquarters for volunteers for a
“Forlorn Hope” to charge in advance of the brigade
line, and storm the enemy’s works tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>There were more than the required number came
forward from the brigade (the call was for 200 men
from the brigade) and ninety-two men were accepted
from the 48th Massachusetts. The following are the
names of those accepted from the 48th: Lieut.-Col.
O’Brien; Co. A, Capt. Woodward, Lieut. Morrison,
Privates E. C. Varina, N. F. Peabody, Isaac F. Porter,
Henry M. Cross; Co. C, Lieut. Emery; Co. D, Private

Daniel Crowley, Ed. Ryan, J. Gallagher, James Rand,
J. Keenan.</p>

<p>May 27. Before the men had had their breakfast
orders were received to assault the enemy’s works.
Immediately we advanced quietly to the extreme edge
of the woods where we laid on our arms till about 2
o’clock in the afternoon, the “Forlorn Hope” under
command of Lieut.-Col. O’Brien in the advance. At
that hour and before the main line had fairly formed
for the assault we received a volley from the enemy’s
guns and at the same time the zip of the rebel bullets
was getting unpleasantly frequent. General Augur,
who stood very near, seeing the men dodge their heads
at the disagreeable sound said, “No use boys to dodge
them after you hear them,” a fact we soon learned by
experience. The “Forlorn Hope” had commenced the
charge, O’Brien saying, “Come boys! pick up your
bundles and follow me,” and General Augur gave
the command, “Forward the Brigade,” and the
whole brigade advanced into the “slashings.” The
whole forest of large trees and small had been
felled and the limbs lopped off and left upon the
ground, which was entirely covered with the stumps,
logs and brush; and through this almost impenetrable
Chevaux de Frise, the men attempted to charge, and
over which a perfect storm of shell, canister and rifle
bullets flew like hail; no formation could be maintained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
over such grounds and in a few moments it was every
one for himself. The “Forlorn Hope” and the main
line became inextricably mixed, and advanced together,
charged nearly up to the rebel works, but the fire was
so severe that human endurance was not equal to the
task set for us, and the men were compelled to drop
behind stumps and logs, and take advantage of any
shelter to be found, and acted as sharpshooters, hoping
that reinforcements might be sent up and continue the
assault. The 2d Louisiana from Dudley’s brigade
came up the road later, but too late to be of any service,
and the assault was abandoned, and the men
dropped back individually to their old line as best they
could. Col. Chapin, 116th New York, commanding the
brigade, Lieut.-Col. O’Brien, 48th Massachusetts, commanding
the “Forlorn Hope,” and many others were
killed; Capt. Rogers, Co. H, Capt. Smith, Co. I, Lieuts.
Morrison, Frawley, Maginnis, Ricker, Bassett and Harding,
and many others wounded, and a large number of
the rank and file of the regiment were killed or more
or less seriously wounded; Lieut. Ricker suffered the
amputation of his leg. As we came back from the
front, we had our first sight of the dreadful effects of
a battle and burial of the dead in one line, about twenty
dead bodies lying at the side of the road, and the long
trench all ready to receive them. Poor fellows, with
no coffin and no shroud but the blue uniform in which
they had shed their blood for the flag they loved.</p>

<p>May 28. Ambulances and stretchers under flags of
truce have been going all night, bringing in the bodies
of the dead and wounded. Col. Chapin’s body has been
sent to New Orleans. Lieut.-Col. O’Brien’s body has
just been found in the most advanced line. When his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
clothes were opened the bullet which penetrated his
body fell out, it having passed entirely through him
and flattened up against a steel vest which he wore into
the battle. He recklessly exposed himself and lost his
life by so doing, seeking to retrieve himself from Gen.
Augur’s kindly criticism of his mistake of the 21st at
Plains Store.</p>

<p>May 29. The regiment laid on their arms all night
in expectation of an attack by the garrison, but the
night passed away and all has been quiet in camp today.
Several heavy thunder showers in the afternoon.
Orders received to fall in with all our traps and go to
the rear; mud very deep and the march tedious.</p>

<p>The 2d Louisiana has been attached to our brigade
and Col. Charles J. Paine of that regiment, being
senior Colonel, takes command of the brigade. He is
a Massachusetts man and is said to be a fine officer.</p>

<p>May 30. Cannonading going on all the night and
day from the batteries and from the fleet. Marched
back to our old camp in front.</p>

<p>June 1. A Lieutenant of sharpshooters wounded
during the early morning. Gen. Banks was much chagrined
at the failure of the first assault. Regiment
marched back to the rear after dark to support batteries.
Laid in cornfield with cornstalks for bedding
and pillow.</p>

<p>June 2. Regiment got into line at 4 o’clock and
marched back to old camp ground. Co. E detailed to
go to the rear to guard the baggage train to relieve
Co. G.</p>

<p>June 3. Smart cannonading all night. Gen. Banks
and Admiral Farragut give the rebs no peace day or
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>June 4. Regiment marched back to the old camp
in front. Four men of Co. B reported from Baton
Rouge.</p>

<p>June 5. Officers ordered to report at Brigade Headquarters
to confer about Lieutenant-Colonelcy. The
laws of Massachusetts state explicitly that the vacancy
shall be filled by the votes of the line officers of the
regiment.</p>

<p>June 6. Rumored preparations for another assault.
Col. Stone sent for Capt. Stanwood and requested him
to act as Lieutenant-Colonel till the vacancy could be
legally filled, saying that an election would soon be
ordered.</p>

<p>June 7. False alarm in the night. Man with nightmare
disturbed camp by upsetting a stack of guns and
bringing out the whole regiment. Inspection at 9
o’clock A. M.</p>

<p>June 8. Harrison W. Dearborn, Co. B, died at
Baton Rouge. Immense lots of cotton bales being
hauled to the front for breastworks.</p>

<p>June 9. Smart firing during the night. Large fire
to be seen in Port Hudson.</p>

<p>June 10. Some heavy cannonading during the
night. Chaplain came up from Baton Rouge with mail
today. Quartermaster came up from Baton Rouge with
new teams.</p>

<p>June 11. Many of the men are suffering badly from
rheumatism, malaria and kindred ailments, acquired
from lying in the rifle pits, which are much of the time
half full of water. Nothing more has been said regarding
an election of Lieutenant-Colonel, and there is
much speculation among the officers and men as to the
reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>June 12. An election for Lieutenant-Colonel was
ordered by Col. Stone and held today and Capt. Stanwood
was unanimously chosen.</p>

<p>June 13. The regiment received orders at 10 o’clock
A. M. to report to Gen. Augur’s headquarters at once.
On reporting to Gen. Augur we were ordered to march
away to the right to report to Gen. Arnold, chief of
artillery. Reported at about 11 o’clock after a very
quick march, in which many of the men suffered terribly,
it being in the very heat of the day and with but
one halt on the road; we must have marched at least
seven or eight miles. Stacked arms and took entrenching
tools&mdash;which in plain English means picks and
shovels and axes. Some of the companies were detailed
to clear out a big ravine which led up in the
direction of the rebel breastworks and just in the rear
of where it was intended to plant a battery, while
others were busied in throwing up the breastworks,
carrying up ammunition and other duties. Worked
till dark and without supper; made preparations to
bivouac, when we were ordered to take up our march
again to our old camp at the rear near the Plains
Store, whence we had started in the morning. Arrived
in camp late in the evening, and after enjoying (?)
coffee and hardtack laid our tired bones on the ground
with the hope of gaining some rest; but our hopes were
blasted. We had got scarcely settled to rest when the
following order was received directly from Gen. Banks’
headquarters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Headquarters, Department of the Gulf.<br />
“Before Port Hudson, June 13, 1863, 8.45 P. M.<br />
</p>

<p>“Maj.-Gen. Augur will order the 48th Massachusetts,
Col. Stone, to proceed at once to the headquarters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the 2d Division and report for temporary duty to Brig.-Gen.
William Dwight, commanding the Division. A
general assault upon the works of the enemy at Port
Hudson will be made tomorrow morning, 14th instant.”</p>
</div>

<p>The regiment got into line, being nearly 500 strong
(or weak), but so used up that many fell out during
the march through the woods, which occupied nearly
all the night&mdash;the guide sent with us losing the way&mdash;and
it was nearly morning when Col. Stone reported to
Gen. Dwight. It was intended that we should occupy
the extreme left on the river bank and make our charge
at that point; but after reconnoitering the ground we
were moved further to the right, to near the Mount
Pleasant road, and bivouacked at the side of the road.</p>

<p>June 14. A dense fog prevailing and terribly hot.
Col. Stone reported to Gen. Dwight at a very early
hour, before light, with 175 men and four Captains
present for duty, the rest of the men having become
exhausted by the work of yesterday and the night
march through the woods, having started from Plains
Store yesterday morning with nearly 500 men.</p>

<p>A tremendous artillery fire for an hour commenced
at about 3 o’clock, both from land forces and the fleet.
The men present in the regiment were consolidated into
four companies, and Capt. Todd volunteered to take
command of the right company, consisting of remnants
of Cos. B and E.</p>

<p>The bombardment continued fiercely for an hour,
during which time the columns were being formed for
the assault in the rear of a piece of woods; the formation
was in column by companies and Capt. Todd led
the advance. We in the 48th could see the effect of the
rebel fire on the brigade in advance of us, as it turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the corner of the woods into the Mount Pleasant road.
Quickly the order came down to “Forward the Brigade”
(we were attached for the day to the brigade commanded
by Col. Benedict). When we came out from
the shelter of the woods the fire of the enemy was terrible,
but the column moved forward firmly; the rebel
line of breastworks was clearly defined before us, with
the “Citadel” frowning in the front. As we advanced
the march from quick time soon became double quick,
and finally a mad rush, passing over dead and wounded
in the road. The air fairly hissed with bullets and
shell, the groans of the wounded mingled with the
cheers and yells of the charging troops, the shouts of
the officers and also their imprecations as some poor
fellows, losing their presence of mind, would try to
dodge the flying missiles as they passed to bury themselves
with a sickening “thud” in some other doomed
comrade’s body; it seemed as if pandemonium was let
loose, and when we overtook and passed over the prostrate
bodies of the red clothed fascine bearers, who had
started in advance of the main column and who, unable
to face the leaden storm, had dropped their burdens
and taken shelter behind them, they were greeted
with cries of derision, which quickly changed to cries
of dismay when we came into the vortex and saw the
ground swept as it were by a whirlwind, and every man
sought shelter in ravines, behind stumps, logs and any
object which could afford shelter.</p>

<p>This ended Gen. Dwight’s movement. But it had
advanced our lines so that we held possession of a rough
hill which commanded the “Citadel,” which had been
the objective point of our assault, and which was the
most formidable point in the rebel works. The men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
held themselves well and showed that former experiences
had had a good effect. Capt. Todd was seriously
wounded in the mouth; Adjt. Ogden was slightly
wounded; Darius Nelson of Co. B was killed and others
both killed and wounded. The Lieutenant-Colonel was
thrown down by the explosion of a shell, which happily
did not wound him, but his right leg was serious paralyzed
and he laid on the field all day exposed to the
pitiless fire of the rebel sharpshooters and the scarcely
less endurable rays of the burning Louisiana sun, until
night came and the Ambulance Corps and brought relief.
The scenes on the field were heart-rending, and
the sufferings of the wounded appealed so strongly to
the sympathy of their more fortunate comrades that
lives were lost and others risked attempting to succor
these unfortunate men.</p>

<p>The movement was much criticized by some of the
officers, especially the cannonade which preceded the
assault, as it is said that by it the rebs were apprised
that an assault was to be made and they were prepared
to repel it, and the day which had opened so auspiciously
ended in gloom. Details of stretcher-bearers
plying their melancholy duty carried the wounded to
the hospitals, and the dead swiftly to the long trenches.</p>

<p>June 15. Regiment was relieved from support of
battery and marched leisurely back to our old camp
near the front center. The men were almost entirely
exhausted, but it was impossible to excuse them from
duty, as all are in the same condition.</p>

<p>June 16. Received orders during the day calling for
volunteers for another storming party of 1000 men.</p>

<p>June 17. Passed the night in the rifle pits. There
was a very heavy rain early in the morning, filling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
pits and making the situation very disagreeable. Order
in regard to detail of one officer and twenty-five men
for storming party countermanded, as more than the
required number had volunteered.</p>

<p>June 18. Regiment supporting an Indiana battery,
at the front, early in the morning having moved in to
the rifle pits.</p>

<p>June 20. Sharpshooters are making things lively.
There are rumors floating through the camps that
Vicksburg has fallen. Regiment ordered to move into
the rifle pits at dark.</p>

<p>June 21. Regiment occupied the rifle pits last night.
The 2d Vermont Battery kept up a kind of intermittent
firing. Regiment relieved at night and returned to the
rear, bivouacking in the woods.</p>

<p>June 22. Election held in Co. B for vacant offices.
Lieut. Merrill was elected Captain, receiving 16 votes
to 15 for Lieut. Rollins; 1st Sergt. James S. Walsh
was elected Second Lieutenant.</p>

<p>June 23. There has been considerable discussion of
the vexing question of termination of service. There
are very few officers left with the regiment, and the
duty is very hard in consequence.</p>

<p>June 24. Lieut. Maginnis (who was wounded in
the assault of the 27th of May) died of his wounds
today.</p>

<p>June 26. Orders received to take the regiment to
the rear and bivouac near Brigade Headquarters, and
just at night ordered to relieve the 2d Louisiana in the
advance rifle pits.</p>

<p>June 27. Col. Stone on the sick list. After being
relieved from the rifle pits ordered to go to the left and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
support the 49th Massachusetts and 21st Maine, which
we did, bivouacking at 11 o’clock P. M.</p>

<p>June 29. Heavy cannonading all night. An attempt
was made a little to our left and front to capture
an outpost of ours, but it failed; the rebs were repulsed,
and it is said with a loss of 90 prisoners; cannot
vouch for the truth of the rumor. Regiment ordered
into the rifle pits to support Holcomb’s 2d Vermont
Battery.</p>

<p>June 30. Were in the rifle pits near Holcomb’s Battery
all night. There were sounds of a smart skirmish
down on the extreme left, which continued about an
hour. Col. Stone left today for Baton Rouge, sick.</p>

<p>July 1. Regiment bivouacking near Brigade Headquarters.
Rebs made a raid into Springfield Landing,
stampeding the guards and destroying a considerable
amount of government stores.</p>

<p>July 2. Regiment has laid in the woods near Brigade
Headquarters this forenoon. Near noon orders
came to fall in to repel an attack from the rebs in the
rear who had raided Springfield Landing and after destroying
the government stores there were now on the
march for Port Hudson. The “march to Port Hudson”
proved to be a hoax, and the regiment was soon
dismissed and at night went into the front rifle pits.</p>

<p>July 3. Regiment occupied the rifle pits, supporting
Holcomb’s Battery. Rebel sharpshooters very active.
Gen. Grover visited the battery this afternoon. He
looks anxious and careworn. Relieved from rifle pits
by the 116th New York.</p>

<p>July 4. National salute fired at sunrise with shotted
guns. This is not our usual way of celebrating our
National birthday. Regiment received orders to get into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
line prepared to make another assault. The “Forlorn
Hope” was already in position at the front. The regiment
stood in line many long and weary hours, anxiously
awaiting the signal gun to commence the assault.
For some reason the assault was not made, and
after a tedious wait we were relieved and allowed to return
to camp. Another salute with shotted guns was
fired at noon by Nims’ Battery. A member of Co. E,
who was captured from us on May 21st at Plains Store,
escaped from Port Hudson today and came back to
camp.</p>

<p>July 5. Gen. Banks has just passed up to the front
with a flag of truce. Ordered into the rifle pits at
night.</p>

<p>July 6. Passed the night in the rifle pits. The regiment
is being rapidly decimated by hard duty and exposure
to this terrible hot weather.</p>

<p>July 7. Two rebels came into headquarters from
Port Hudson, and their accounts show that the garrison
can hold out but a very short time.</p>

<p>Official news has been received from Gen. Grant
that Vicksburg surrendered on the 4th. A gunboat
came down river from that place early this morning
bringing the news. Communication with the army
was for some reason broken and it was quite late in the
day before the message was delivered to Gen. Banks.
It was at once communicated to the troops in the
trenches; from man to man, from company to company,
from regiment to regiment the word passed, and
the cheers from the men rang out and the long silenced
bands filled the forests with the strains of the “Star
Spangled Banner,” “America,” “Yankee Doodle” and
other patriotic music. Received orders for the 48th to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
occupy the rifle pits and support Holcomb’s 2d Vermont
Battery tonight.</p>

<p>Before going on duty the Lieutenant-Colonel visited
Gen. Augur’s headquarters, by his request, and was particularly
instructed and cautioned as to his duty. He
said, “You are going into the most important position
on the line, and as the ranking officer on the brigade
picket line you will be expected to exercise the greatest
vigilance. The information we have leads us to expect
that the enemy will offer to surrender or make an attempt
to break out through our thin lines, and it is expected
that you will be prepared for either or any
emergency. Double your outer picket line, keep your
men well in hand and allow none to sleep. If any attempt
is made to break out it must be prevented at all
hazards till reinforcements reach you, which you may
feel assured will be pushed forward to your assistance
at the first alarm, and you must check the attack at the
hazard of your lives; two companies from another regiment
will be ordered into the rifle pits to strengthen
your line.” Regiment went into the rifle pits at about
9 o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>July 8. The inevitable has happened! Port Hudson
has fallen! Regiment laid quietly in rifle pits till
shortly after 12 o’clock, midnight, the notes of a bugle
were heard in our front sounding “a parley,” and a
few seconds later an officer with a small escort approached,
bearing a lantern fixed to a long pole, with
a white handkerchief tied beneath it to serve as a flag
of truce. At the outpost the flag was halted and its
object ascertained, which was the delivery of a dispatch
to Gen. Banks from Gen. Gardner, in command of the
Confederate forces in Port Hudson, which was immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>dispatched to Gen. Banks’ headquarters by messenger.
The dispatch contained a request for official
assurance as to the truth of the report that Vicksburg
had surrendered. If true, Gardner asked for a cessation
of hostilities, with a view to consider terms of surrender
of Port Hudson, and soon a blast upon a bugle
brought back the little party of Confederates with the
lantern swinging from the pole and the conference culminated
in an agreement to surrender, and that a commission
be appointed from each side to agree upon

</div>

<p>Orders were immediately issued to cease firing all
along the line and also from the fleet. Brig.-Gen. C.
P. Stone, Col. Birge and Brig.-Gen. Dwight were designated
by Gen. Banks as such commission. At 9 o’clock
this morning the commissioners from both armies met
just in front of our position, and nearly on the spot
where Lieut.-Col. O’Brien had formed his men while
waiting for the word on that eventful 27th of May.
On the Confederate side the commissioners were Col.
Miles, Col. Steedman, 1st Alabama, and Lieut.-Col.
Smith, Chief of Artillery. Gen. Andrew was designated
to receive the surrender, which it was finally decided
should take place tomorrow morning, the 9th.
The men of the 48th can feel with considerable satisfaction
that through the carrying out of Col. Paine’s
plan (to crowd the hard work of the siege onto the nine
months regiments) they have been placed in a position
where they can claim the honor of receiving the flag
of truce which surrendered this great stronghold after
so many weary and exciting weeks of fighting, digging
and suffering. While the negotiations have been going
on officers from some of the rebel regiments came over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
into our lines and fraternized with us as socially as
though no state of war ever existed between the two
sections of the country, and one officer expressed the
wish that the war could now close and the North and
South combine and whip out England; his reason being
“that England had not recognized the independence
of the Confederacy after the Trent affair.”</p>

<p>July 9. The 48th was in line promptly at 4.30 this
morning, in accordance with orders, but was obliged to
wait until nearly 10 o’clock before commencing to
march into Port Hudson, en route for Donaldsonville,
at which hour the 48th with the Massachusetts 49th
and 21st Maine took up the line of march to the landing
and embarked on board steamer “Louisiana Belle”
late in the afternoon after the ceremony of surrender,
which was very short. The rebels were drawn up in line
with Gen. Gardner at their head, the right resting near
the railroad station. When the command “ground
arms” was given every man placed his musket upon
the ground. It was a very affecting sight, and there
was no man in the victorious army who did not experience
a feeling of pity go out to the brave men who had
been compelled to surrender after so long and so brilliant
defense. Gen. Gardner tendered his sword to Gen.
Andrews who declined to receive it. The rebel flag was
hauled down from the flagstaff where it so defiantly
floated through the siege. A salute was fired by the
naval battery, the stars and stripes run up. The garrison
filed off as prisoners of war, and all was over.</p>

<p>More than 6,000 rebels surrendered. The soldiers
were paroled but the officers were held as prisoners of
war. Twenty pieces of heavy artillery and more than
30 pieces of field artillery were captured. The loss of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the 19th army corps during the siege has been nearly
5,000 men. No correct account has been made of the
rebel loss, but an approximate calculation will give it as
nearly 1,000, which, considering that their fighting has
been entirely behind breastworks, is very heavy. Port
Hudson is a very strong place and would have cost us
many more men to have taken it by storm. As we
steamed away from the landing and gazed at the bluffs
and remembered the long weeks of waiting in front of
its land batteries we could but take a long drawn sigh
of relief. We shall no doubt soon be sent home.
Home! Can any outside the army imagine what this
word means to us who have lain so many weary weeks
in the swamps of Louisiana, watching the lines of the
enemy with the eyes of hungry wolves, dying by hundreds,
by bullet, and shell, and disease. It means
friends, comfort, life itself, in exchange for misery,
squalor, dirt, a dog’s life, and death, and an unknown
grave.</p>

<p>July 10. Reached Donaldsonville at 9 o’clock A. M.
While on the passage down, and we were at breakfast,
the steamer was fired on from the shore, but happily
no one was hit. The shots were returned from the boat,
but with what results of course we could not know, but
we were not further molested.</p>

<p>After landing we made a reconnaissance till nearly
dark when the regiment bivouacked for the night near
the levee. The rebels have evidently drawn away their
forces from the river and we shall probably have to seek
them further inland.</p>

<p>July 11. False alarm in the night. Regiment fell
in with arms, but were soon dismissed.</p>

<p>July 12. A steamer came up from New Orleans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
which shows that the blockade is raised, and the Mississippi
river throughout its whole length is clear for the
first time in two whole years.</p>

<p>July 13. Col. Paine’s brigade received orders while
at breakfast to fall in and march to support Col. Dudley.
Marched out several miles and halted to make
preparations for dinner, there being no indications of
being called into action very soon. Some were fortunate
enough to dine early, their meal being very
frugal, and hard tack and coffee constituted their principal
fare, and a little green corn from the fields. We
were startled by the rattle of musketry in our immediate
front, and we were at once ordered into line and
found that Dudley was engaged with the enemy and
had been gradually driving them back until he came
upon their main line, when he was in turn being slowly
and obstinately forced back. Our brigade was now
ordered to the front at “double quick” on the road parallel
to the bayou, and soon ordered to file to the right
into a little green plantation road or path, and halted,
our left resting on the bayou road. In our front was a
rail fence with a deep ditch at the side of the road;
beyond the fence an open field of about 125 yards extent
and beyond that an immense corn field. By the waving
of the corn tops we could trace the movements of Dudley’s
men and could see that they were slowly retreating
and coming back gradually towards our line. The
regiment was ordered to occupy the ditch at the side of
the road. Very soon Dudley’s men made their appearance
out of the corn, loading and firing as they fell
slowly back. A more soldierly appearance could not
have been made than was made by the regiment in our
immediate front (the 161st New York. Col. Harrower,)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
as they retired, slowly, towards our line, turning
and firing as they retreated. They came over the fence
in our front and passed over us to our rear, where they
laid down. The rebels followed them closely to the
edge of the cornfield, and attempted to cross the open
field in our front, but were immediately sent to the
“right about” in some confusion, by the fire from the
trusty rifles in the hands of the 48th boys who laid close
to the ground, firing under the bottom rail in the
fence, and the range being low the shots were very
effective.</p>

<p>A short time previous, Col. Paine had taken the
49th out of their place in line, which was on our immediate
right, leaving a gap in the brigade line which the
48th was directed to cover with an oblique fire, thus
giving us double ground to cover. Col. Paine before
leaving with the 49th came to Lieut.-Col. Stanwood
and directed him to hold our ground at all hazards till
his return.</p>

<p>The rebels tried several times to charge across the
open field in our front, but were as often driven back by
the steady fire from our men in the ditch.</p>

<p>While this was transpiring, the rebels had driven back
the brigade on the opposite side of the bayou until their
fire enfiladed the left of our brigade, and at the same
time were rapidly flanking the whole force on our
right which began to fall back, and in a short time we
were left alone upon the field. A staff officer from Col.
Dudley rode up and ordered the Lieutenant-Colonel to
retire the regiment. His authority was not recognized,
Lieut.-Col. Stanwood having received orders from our
own brigade commander (Col. Paine) to hold the
ground at all hazards until his return, which order he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
held himself bound to obey. Soon on looking to the
right and left not a blue-coated soldier could be seen,
and away to the right the rebel could be seen passing
rapidly to the rear. On the opposite side of the bayou
the fighting was going on far to our rear while from
our front in the corn desultory shots came, viciously
striking the fence rails above our heads. Feeling that
in this case “discretion was the better part of valor” and
not caring to be a second Casabianca, he directed the
men to pass the word quietly down the line, without
rising, and retire from their position as best they could,
and rally in the rear on the colors.</p>

<p>This they did, and the rebs were so close that many
of the men were captured before they had time to retire
from the ditch! The 48th lost in killed, wounded and
missing 65 out of a total 201 men engaged. Lieut.
Wilson, Co. D, and Lieut. Bassett, Co. I, were taken
prisoners. Lieut. Wilson was reported as also wounded.</p>

<p>The men after retiring from the ditch rallied in the
rear, and later took their place in the line of the
brigade in the rear and in a low swamp. A tremendous
rain storm came up towards night flooding our
camp.</p>

<p>July 14. Our camp is located in a low swamp and is
completely inundated. The men are all thoroughly
soaked to the skin. The day has been spent in bringing
in the dead and wounded. Among the dead is Edward
T. Bennett of Co. B.</p>

<p>July 15. Still in camp at Donaldsonville. Received
dispatches from New Orleans, announcing a great victory
in Pennsylvania by Gen. Meade’s army, on the 1st,
2d and 3d days of July. The first week in July has
been a week of tremendous importance to the Union<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
cause&mdash;Vicksburg-Port Hudson, and now this great
victory of Gen. Meade’s at Gettysburg&mdash;three names long
to be remembered in American history. We hear that
Col. Stone has recovered his horse which was captured
from him at the battle of Plains Store, May 21.</p>

<p>July 16. Regiment received orders to change camp
to the rear to secure higher ground, by which move the
48th has secured the best location in the brigade line.
There are all sorts of rumors in regard to going home.
Suppose that some of them may be true and expect
that now that Port Hudson has been taken that we
shall be sent home before long. Received word from
Baton Rouge that Joseph B. Hale of Co. B died in the
hospital there today.</p>

<p>July 17. All prisoners taken from us on the 13th
have been paroled, and have returned to camp today
having marched from Thibodaux. They say that the
rebs had less than a thousand men on our side of the
bayou in the battle, and our defeat was all owing to bad
generalship on the part of our commanding officers.</p>

<p>July 18. Daniel F. Connell of Co. B who was taken
prisoner on the 13th, came back to camp today, having
been paroled, and walked from the rebel camp (which
he thinks is nearly 100 miles from here) with one hardtack
and a little corn meal for his rations during the
march.</p>

<p>He thinks there are from 10,000 to 20,000 rebels
between Donaldsonville and Thibodaux, with considerable
artillery. A continued discussion of the question
of “going home” now principally occupies the time of
the men.</p>

<p>July 21. Capt. Bainbridge, a U. S. army officer,
came to camp today and the Lieutenant-Colonel at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
once went before him and was mustered out as captain
and immediately mustered in as Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>

<p>July 22. Capt. Schoff, Lieut. Morrison with a detail
of thirty-three men went foraging at 4.30 this morning
and returned at 3 P. M. having gone out about nine
miles and obtained a large amount of corn. The regiment
is now nearly destitute of commissioned officers.</p>

<p>July 23. The glorious news from Gen. Meade’s
army confirmed. Gen. Lee entirely defeated at Gettysburg,
Penn., and driven back into Virginia. Our
friends at home have by this time heard of our victory
at Port Hudson and will be now looking for our return.
Heavy thunder showers today.</p>

<p>July 24. Paymaster Maj. Palmer arrived at 7.30
o’clock A. M. and proceeded to pay off the regiment,
which feat was accomplished at noon. Maj. Palmer informs
us that the campaign is over and the men are
being sent home as fast as transportation can be
furnished.</p>

<p>July 25. Alarm in the night caused by the pickets
firing into some old horse or mule.</p>

<p>July 26. Col. Love, 116th New York, in command
of the brigade during Col. Paine’s absence.</p>

<p>July 27. Very quiet in camp last night.</p>

<p>July 29. Regiment received drums today, and resumed
regular dress parades which have been greatly
interfered with during the siege of Port Hudson and
during the stay here in Donaldsonville.</p>

<p>July 30. The camp here at Donaldsonville is evidently
breaking up; some of the troops are on the move
at daylight. Gen. Weitzel’s old brigade has marched
for Thibodaux. We are still kept on the “ragged edge”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
all the time looking for orders to start for Baton Rouge
and home.</p>

<p>July 31. Orders have been received at headquarters
for our removal to Baton Rouge, as soon as transportation
can be furnished. At 11.30 o’clock this forenoon
orders were received to prepare to move immediately.
Several steamers have come and gone but none for us as
yet, which is very tantalizing.</p>

<p>August 1. Steamer “Kepper” arrived and the 48th
immediately went on board as also the 49th. Quarters
were very much crowded and the men have suffered
intensely on the hot deck during the passage up the
river to Baton Rouge where we arrived just before dark.
Disembarked with military precision.</p>

<p>August 2. Glad to get to our old quarters which
seems something like home. During the night some of
the men were jubilantly celebrating their return and
became over-boisterous. The chaplain’s tent caught fire
from some mysterious cause and burned down. Col.
Stone, although having left the regiment when in front
of Port Hudson, and remained in Baton Rouge since
that time on the sick list, took command of the regiment
at once.</p>

<p>August 3. Col. Stone decided that he is able to take
command of the regiment. How little we anticipated
when we left Baton Rouge in May what changes would
take place before we should return in August&mdash;Lieut.-Col.
O’Brien and so many other brave and good men
gone.</p>

<p>August 4. The Colonel has reported for duty.
Orders have been received for an inspection of the
regiment which at this time looks much like going home.</p>

<p>August 5. Our old parade ground which we used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
when we first came to Baton Rouge does not look at all
familiar. The 49th Regiment has received orders to
take transportation for New Orleans at once.</p>

<p>August 6. We are expecting every moment to get
orders to start for home, and the delay is very vexatious.</p>

<p>August 7. Received orders to start for home by way
of the Mississippi river and Cairo, Ill. (and in consequence
we are all feeling happy), as soon as transportation
can be secured.</p>

<p>August 8. The men are all busily engaged cleaning
up guns and equipments to turn over before going
home. Home! how pleasant the sound, when it means
so much to us who have for so long a time been deprived
of all the comforts of home.</p>

<p>August 9. Inspection came off this morning at 7
o’clock and everything was found in “spick and span”
condition. Notice has been received that the steamer
is awaiting us at the landing, and we have turned in all
ordnance and ordnance stores, surplus clothing, camp
and garrison equipage and are now on board steamer
“Sunny South” ready for the start.</p>

<p>August 10. Steamer started up river at 3 o’clock this
morning and arrived opposite Port Hudson at sunrise.
Our passing of the batteries was much more quietly
accomplished than was Commodore Farragut’s last
March. The scenery on the Mississippi River is very
monotonous and tame. Have passed only one little
village today. Fort Adams passed at 3 o’clock P. M.
The men are suffering terribly from heat on the “burning
deck.” At 10 P. M. arrived at Natchez. Since
coming to Louisiana we have been using New Orleans
horse car tickets and postage stamps for change.</p>

<p>August 11. We left Natchez at 5 P. M. The bluffs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
here at Natchez are 150 feet in height. The city is
very prettily situated. Passed village of Washington
on the left at 10.30 A. M.; Passed Gen. Taylor’s plantation
at 11.30 A. M.; Grand Gulf at 3 P. M.&mdash;a very
strong place. Passed wreck of Indianola at sunset.
Arrived at Vicksburg soon after 11 o’clock at night.</p>

<p>August 12. Passed head of the celebrated Vicksburg
canal at 11.15 A. M. Passed Millican’s Bend at 2
o’clock P. M. Steamer “Tempest” with the 49th
Massachusetts on board has passed up.</p>

<p>August 13. Passed Napoleon Ark at the mouth of
the Arkansas River about 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>August 14. Arrived at Helena, Ark., at 1.30 P. M.
Stopped to coal till 4 o’clock and went on shore to
stretch our legs during the stay. It is a very strong
natural fortification, and many artificial works have
been erected in addition. Two men were drowned
attempting to come on board.</p>

<p>August 15. Arrived at Memphis at about 6 o’clock
A. M. Left at 11.30 P. M.</p>

<p>August 16. Steamer ran aground and stuck fast for
hours; reached Gayoso Landing at 4 P. M.</p>

<p>One must travel on the Mississippi River to get any
idea of its greatness. Here we go puffing along, day
after day, and night after night, and we wake up every
morning and the same grand old river stretches away
before us.</p>

<p>The distances on the Mississippi River are as follows:
Passes to New Orleans, 125 miles; New Orleans to
Baton Rouge, 130; Baton Rouge to Port Hudson, 30;
Port Hudson to Natchez, 100; Natchez to Vicksburg,
140; Vicksburg to Memphis, 360; Memphis to Cairo,
240; total 1125 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>August 17. Arrived opposite Columbus, Kentucky,
at 8 A. M. when the steamer was brought to by a shot
across her bows from the Battery at this point. Arrived
at Cairo, Ill., at 10 A. M. While stopping here
there has been some trouble with some of the more
turbulent men on account of their not being allowed to
go on shore.</p>

<p>August 18. At 10 o’clock A. M. commenced changing
baggage from the steamer to the cars which occupied
the time till about dark when the regiment went on
board the cars and run out about 20 miles to a station
called Wetaug, arriving a little before midnight and
stopped till daylight. The delay is very tedious and
vexatious. We are going home and trains going to the
front have the right of way and so we are side-tracked
to await their passing.</p>

<p>August 20. Still dragging slowly along. Arrived
at Indianapolis, Ind., at 11 o’clock A. M. Regiment
marched to the Soldiers’ Home where a bountiful
collation was furnished by the people of the city. James
H. Short of Co. B, who was very sick when we left
Baton Rouge, was left here in the hospital, he not being
able to travel further.</p>

<p>August 21. Arrived at Gallion, Ohio, at 6 o’clock
A. M. Could get nothing to eat on arrival, being at
so early an hour. Reached Crestline at 6.30 A. M.;
Cleveland at noon. Here we met with a very kind
reception from the citizens with a good dinner; also the
same repeated at Erie, Penn. Reached Buffalo at 9.30
P. M. and received another splendid reception with
collation. Here we changed cars and started for
Albany at about midnight.</p>

<p>August 22. Arrived at Utica at 10.30 A. M. and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
were tendered another fine collation spread at the side
of the track. Continued on for Albany where we
arrived about 4 o’clock P. M.; went at once to the ferry
and cars en route for Boston at sunset. Made good time
and arrived at Springfield, Mass., at midnight. Here
a few minutes were allowed to obtain lunch for which
we had to pay a good round price&mdash;the first which has
cost us a cent since leaving Cairo, and some considerable
comment has been made that Massachusetts should be
the first to ask her returning soldiers to pay for their
rations.</p>

<p>August 23. Arrived in Boston without further incidents
at 7.30 A. M. Marched to the Beach Street
Barracks where we were served a government ration
(which did not compare favorably with the food served
out to us by the citizens of the cities and towns through
which we have passed on our way home) after which
the men were furloughed till September 3, then to
report at our old Camp Lander at Wenham to be
mustered out.</p>

<p>September 3. Regiment reported at Camp Lander,
Wenham, and were mustered out. Casualties during
the campaign: Killed and died of wounds, 23;
wounded, 73; died of disease, 40; total, 136.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. Christopher C. Augur was in command of
the 1st Division, 19th Army Corps, to which the 48th
Massachusetts was attached and served its whole term
of service.</p>

<p>He was born in New York, but was appointed to
West Point from Michigan; graduated 16th in the class
of 1843 (in which class Gen. Grant was the 21st).
He served in the Mexican war with credit, and at the
breaking out of the Rebellion was given a commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
of Brigadier-General of Volunteers Nov. 12, 1861; was
in command of a Division under Gen. Banks in the
Shenandoah Valley, and was wounded severely at Cedar
Mountain, receiving therefor a brevet of Colonel in the
Regular Army; was promoted to Major-General of Volunteers,
Aug. 9, 1862, and assigned to the command of
the left wing of the army before Port Hudson, retired
as full Brigadier-General in the Regular Army in 1885.</p>

<p>Colonel Edward P. Chapin, who commanded the 1st
Brigade in Gen. Augurs Division, of which the 48th
Massachusetts constituted a part, was the Colonel of the
116th New York. He was a very able and efficient
officer, and it was expected that he would rise to
advanced rank, but was killed in the desperate assault
on Port Hudson, May 27, 1863, and thus the army and
the country lost the services of a very promising officer.
He was succeeded in the command of the Brigade by
Col. Charles J. Paine of the 2d Louisiana Infantry,
who remained in command during the remainder of the
48th’s term, and subsequently received the brevets of
Brigadier and Major-General of Volunteers.</p>

<p>The regiment, as finally made up, represented all
classes. It contained recruits from the best old New
England families in Essex and Middlesex, and from
emigrants recently from foreign countries. A good
example of the former was the late Samuel Hoar of
Concord (son of the late Judge E. Rockwood Hoar and
nephew of the late Senator George F. Hoar), who left
college to enlist as a private soldier in Company E, and
who served the full term, then re-entered and graduated
at Harvard College. He subsequently became a very
able lawyer and distinguished citizen. He died April
11th, 1904, aged 59 years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Col. Eben F. Stone was a man of high character
and standing in the community in which he lived, and
that had much to do with his selection to command the
regiment. As time went on he failed somewhat as a
tactician, and the regiment was at a disadvantage on
this account, although he could have passed an excellent
examination in tactics. He was a brave officer and
well liked by the officers and soldiers of his regiment.
Colonel Stone, after the war, made an honorable record
in the civil service of the government. He served two
years in the State Senate and two terms in Congress.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. O’Brien was regarded as a good officer
and brave to the degree of recklessness.</p>

<p>Capt. Stanwood earned the promotion which he
received by a unanimous election as Lieutenant-Colonel
by able, faithful, and patriotic services.</p>

<p>Dr. Yorick G. Hurd was one of the best surgeons of
the Civil War. The death rate from sickness in our
regiment was less than in any other in the Department,
and that was due in great part to the faithful, conscientious,
and untiring services of Dr. Hurd. He had not
a lazy bone in his body. After the war he rendered good
services in the military and civil service of the State.
He was medical director of the Division on the Staff of
General B. F. Butler, with rank of Colonel, from 1867
to 1876. He served two years in the State Senate. He
did for many years excellent service as Master of the
House of Correction and Superintendent of the Insane
Asylum at Ipswich.</p>

<p>Capt. Edgar J. Sherman (of the same family of
Roger Sherman and General William T. Sherman),
enlisted as a private soldier and was subsequently elected
Captain of Company F.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>When the regiment advanced on Port Hudson he
was in the hospital sick of malarial fever. Hearing of
the affair of Plains Store, the Captain, somewhat relieved
of the fever but weak and emaciated, decided to
join the regiment. The surgeons tried to induce him to
remain a while longer, but not succeeding in this, gave
orders forbidding it. The next morning the Captain
put on his uniform, left the hospital, and took the early
steamer for Springfield Landing. There he was met
by the surgeons who called him a “walking ghost,” and
ordered him back to Baton Rouge. The Captain said
he was not going on duty but only to visit the surgeon
of his regiment and he was allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>He was there several days, remaining with Dr. Hurd,
when he learned that there was to be a charge on the
enemy’s works the next day. He at once determined
to go on duty. The Colonel and surgeon advised against
it, withholding their consent, the doctor saying, “Captain,
if you go into this fight and are not killed, your
fever will come back and you will leave your bones in
Louisiana.” Capt. Sherman made the long march that
night, with the aid of his soldiers, and led his two companies
which carried the colors in the charge next day.
When the charge did not succeed and the order came to
get off the field, the Captain finally reached the ravine on
the left, and was subsequently carried on a stretcher to
the rear. Dr. Hurd found him exhausted, with the
fever returning, and ordered him sent at once to the
hospital at Baton Rouge.</p>

<p class="desc">At Baton Rouge, La., 1863.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Just as the Captain was being put into the ambulance
he said to Dr. Hurd, “It is too bad about poor
Captain Todd; he went down right in front of me and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>we went right on over his dead body.” “Not by a d&mdash;&mdash;
sight!” said the Doctor. “I took an old broken French
bayonet three inches long out of his mouth and he is
all right.”</p>

<p>Captain Sherman was seriously and dangerously ill
for some time, and it was feared that the Doctor’s
prophecy might become true,&mdash;that the Captain would
“leave his bones in Louisiana,” but he recovered sufficiently
to return home with the regiment.</p>

<p>Officers and men were so much needed at the time
that Captain Sherman’s disobedience of the order “not
to leave the hospital” was condoned, and upon the
recommendation of his superior officers, he was brevetted
Major “for gallant and meritorious services.”</p>

<p>Major Sherman subsequently served in the military
and civil services of the State. In 1864, at the time
of General Early’s raid on Washington, he raised a company
for one hundred days and was elected its Captain,
and the company became Company K of the 6th
Regiment.</p>

<p>He served as Assistant Adjutant General, with the
rank of Colonel, and as Chief of Staff of the Division,
General B. F. Butler’s, from 1867 to 1876. He served
fourteen years as District Attorney for Essex County,
five years as Attorney General, and now a Justice of the
Superior Court, where he has served since 1887.</p>

<p>Capt. J. Scott Todd was an excellent officer, always
faithful to every duty.</p>

<p>He was wounded and disabled in the charge on June
14. The enemy were short of ammunition and they used
broken iron. An old piece of a French bayonet three
inches long struck him in the mouth, knocking out his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
upper and under front teeth, cutting his tongue in two,
its full length, and finally embedded itself in the roof
of his mouth. The blow was so severe that the Captain
lay on the field stunned and unconscious for a long time.
With assistance he finally reached the rear and the
doctor removed the iron and he was soon in condition
for duty.</p>

<p>After the war the Captain did honorable service in
the civil government of the State. He served two years
in the State Senate. He also served for many years as
a Trial Justice.</p>

<p>The following is taken from Hanson’s History of the
Sixth Regiment:</p>

<p>“Company K, Capt. Edgar J. Sherman, Lawrence.</p>

<p>“This company was a new one, raised mostly in
Lawrence upon the call of the Governor for five
thousand one hundred days men. Recruiting commenced
on the 11th day of July, the company was filled
on the 12th, went into camp on the 13th, was mustered
into service on the 14th and on the 15th and 16th the
men were clothed, armed and equipped throughout and
ready to move on the 17th&mdash;just six days after the first
movement was made.</p>

<p>“Captain Sherman, says the Lawrence American
(edited by Captain Merrill, who was at Port Hudson
in the Fourth Regiment), under extraordinary difficulties,
raised a company of nine months men, enlisting
himself as a private, from which he was promoted to a
Captaincy, and, as we personally know, no braver or
more faithful officer has left our city. Always attentive
to the needs of his men, and even when weak and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
emaciated with sickness, as we saw him at Port Hudson
(in the 48th Massachusetts) leaving the hospital,
against the positive prohibition of the surgeon, to lead
his men in the assault. He was brevetted Major for
‘gallant and meritorious services.’”</p>

<p>The historian does not hold himself responsible for
the absolute accuracy of the regimental roster as errors
may have unavoidably crept in. But the roster was
carefully compiled from the records kept at the State
House and is a complete copy of such records.</p>

</div>


<p>The large number of desertions from some of the
companies is accounted for by the fact that the recruits
were brought to camp by agents of the cities who paid
bounties as soon as the recruits were mustered into the
United States service.</p>

<p>The officers of those companies objected to accepting
such recruits, prophesying that many of them would
desert, but the objections were overruled and the officers
were compelled to accept them.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
